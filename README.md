===
> It's a pratice for using node.js with firebase db service to build a frontend to backend todolist service via RESTful API

## Getting Started

Download and go to firebase "project setting", choose "service account" then you can download private key for your node.js service. (so you need to rename that file to "firebase_key.json" and put it in)

## Introduction

Just a todo list, you can add anything you want to do on it.By the way, it's chinese.

"新增" means `add`, "全部清除" means `clear all`.
